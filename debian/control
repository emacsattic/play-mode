Description: Playwriting typing and typesetting help
 The plywood project is a project to help type and typeset plays. It comprises 
 a small structured-text format, an Emacs mode, a translation program and a 
 LaTeX style. 
 . 
 The goals are:
 .
 1) Reduce the work of the playwright to that of writing a play. Even 
 learning special key strokes is discouraged -- the system should DWIM.
 . 
 2) Make the plays pretty, yet conforming to standard formatting rules. 
 . 
 Currently, we have implemented the Standard American format, as described by 
 Samuel French.
 .
 plywood contains the LaTeX style, and the plywood script to transform 
 plays in the plywood format to LaTeX code and an emacs mode to edit the
 files in.
