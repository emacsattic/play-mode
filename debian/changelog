plywood (0.5.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Debian native packages should not have debian revision numbers.
  * Took out cvs2cl -- people without cvs access might actually want to build
    the package at somepoint (I hope)

plywood (0.5.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a couple of lintian erros. (Still not sure how I'm going to get

plywood (0.5.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * plywood now no longer starts with #!/usr/bin/python2.2
  * Fixed maintainer field in debian/control
  * Removed debian/python-plywood.files for lintian
  * Cleaned out extraneous files in debian
  * Added COPYING file
  * Put better text in debian/copyright
  * Fixed the man page a little
  * plywood no longer depends on python-plywood or plywood-elisp. Rather, it
    recommends them.
  * Added python2.2 to build-depends
  * Made long descriptions more descriptive

plywood (0.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.
  * Fixed depends to depend on python2.2, not python
  * I think I'm going to install under /usr now. :)
  * Added in the LaTeX style to the base plywood package. The whole thing
    makes no sense without the LaTeX style. But you could use the LaTeX style
    without the python translator or the emacs editing mode.
