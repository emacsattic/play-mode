plywood (0.5.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a README and AUTHORS file. I suppose I should give props to people.
  * Added plywood.postinst. I had one of these once, I guess I just missed
    adding it to CVS. Weird.
  * Made plywood use pdflatex by default at the moment, rather than
    latex/dvipdf. In the future (when I'm not at my in-law's) I'd like to add
    options to plywood to produce dvis or pdfs.
  * Changed use of dvipdfm to dvipdf (closes: #146635)

  * Cleaned out extraneous files in debian
  * Added COPYING file

    recommends them.

plywood (0.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.
  * Fixed depends to depend on python2.2, not python
  * I think I'm going to install under /usr now. :)
  * Added in the LaTeX style to the base plywood package. The whole thing
    makes no sense without the LaTeX style. But you could use the LaTeX style
    without the python translator or the emacs editing mode.
