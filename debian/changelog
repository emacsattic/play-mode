plywood (0.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release.
  * Fixed depends to depend on python2.2, not python
  * I think I'm going to install under /usr now. :)
  * Added in the LaTeX style to the base plywood package. The whole thing
    makes no sense without the LaTeX style. But you could use the LaTeX style
    without the python translator or the emacs editing mode.
