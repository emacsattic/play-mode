Plywood is a project to help type and typeset plays. It comprises
a small structured-text format, an Emacs mode, a translation program and a
LaTeX style.
     
The goals are:

  1) Reduce the work of the playwright to that of writing a play. Even
     learning special key strokes is discouraged -- the system should DWIM.

  2) Make the plays pretty, yet conforming to standard formatting rules.

Currently, we have implemented the Standard American format, as described by
Samuel French.

Documentation is very sparse at the moment, but I'm working on it.
