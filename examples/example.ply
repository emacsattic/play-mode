title: An Example Play
author: Monty Taylor

characters:
Monty Taylor (Monty) - A playwright, whom people sometimes call Monty, rather than spell out his whole name. At the moment, descriptions of him are not allowed to contain line breaks. 
Peter Brook - A late director whose work in the theatre Monty quite enjoys. 

newact:

setting: A small, dark, cramped room. A desk sits in one corner,
littered with papers. There are probably things living in the mess,
but finding them seems a bit scary. At least line breaks are handled
properly in other places other than the character list.

at rise: Monty sits at his keyboard typing. He's not really a very
good playwright. In fact, he's a director, but when he does have to
type in plays, he's really annoyed with having to format them as he
types. rms enters from out of nowhere, and starts speaking in a manner
resembling a greek chorus.


Monty = [sighing] I wish there were an easier way to type
plays. Typewriters were so much quicker and easier than
word-processors. [having an idea] Oh wait, there's emacs! And LaTeX. I bet 
the two of them could do things other playwriting programs could only dream of.

[Monty gets up and leaves, because writing plays really isn't his strong suit.]

newscene:

[Peter Brook enters, moving rather slowly because he's dead.] 

Peter Brook = This is the worst play I've ever read.

[blackout]
