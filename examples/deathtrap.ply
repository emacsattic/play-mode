title: Deathtrap
author: Ira Levin

act: one
scene: two

Sidney = Actually it was built in seventeen-/ninety/-four, but they
were out of nines at the hardware store, so I backdated it ten years. 

Clifford = It's a beautiful house. 

Sidney = [Closing the door] Historical Society had kittens. 

Myra = Hello! [She offers her hand; Clifford shakes it warmly]

Sidney = This is Clifford Anderson, dear. My wife Myra. 

Clifford = Hello. It's a pleasure to meet you. 

Myra = Come in. I was beginning to worry ... 

Sidney = Watch out for the beam. 

[Ducking, Clifford comes into the study. Sidney follows.]

Sidney = You can always tell an authentic Colonial by the visitor's
bruised foreheads. [ Myra smiles nervously. Clifford looks about, a
bit awed.]  

Clifford = The room you work in?

Sidney = How did you guess.

Clifford = The typewriter, and all these posters . . . [ He moves
about, studying the window cards. Sidney watches him; Myra glances at
Sidney. Clifford touches the Master's covered typewriter, then points
at the wall] Is that the mace that was used in /Murderer's Child/? 

Sidney = Yes. And the dagger is from /The Murder Game/. [ Clifford
goes closer, touches the dagger blade] Careful, it's sharp. The trick
one was substituted in Act Two.

Clifford = [Moves his hand to an ax handle] /In for the Kill/? 

Sidney = Yes. 

Clifford = I can't understand why that play didn't run . . . 

Sidney = Critics peeing on it might be the answer. [ Clifford goes on with his inspection.] 

Myra = The train must have been late. [ Sidney pays no notice ] 

Clifford = [Turning] No, Mr. Bruhl was. The train was on time. 

Sidney = I had to get gas, and Frank insisted on fondling the spark
plugs. 

Clifford = [ Points at a window card] Do you know that /Gunpoint/ was the first play I ever saw?
I had an aunt in New York, and I came in on the train one Saturday --
by myself, another first -- from Hartford. She took me to the
matinee. I was twelve years old. 

Sidney = If you're trying to depress me, you've made it. 

Clifford = How? Oh. I'm sorry. But that's how I got hooked on
thrillers. 

Sidney = /Angel Street/ did it to me. "Bella, where is that grocery
bill? Eh? What have you done with it, you poor wretched creature?" I
was fifteen. 

Myra = It sounds like a disease, being passed from generation to
generation. 

Sidney = It is a disease: /thrilleritis malignis/, the fevered pusuit
of the one-set five-character moneymaker. 

Clifford = I'm not pursuing money. Not that I wouldn't like to have
some, so I could have a place like this to work in; but that isn't the
reason I wrote /Deathtrap/.

Sidney = You're still an early case.

Clifford = It's not a disease, it's a tradition: a superbly
challenging theatrical framework in which every possible variation
seems to have been played. Can I conjure up a few new ones? Can I
startle an audience that's /been/ on Angel Street, that's dialed "M"
for murder, that's witnessed the prosecution, that's played the murder
game -- 

Sidney = Lovely speech! And that's for saving me for last.

Clifford = I was coming to /Sleuth/.

Sidney = I'm glad I stopped you. 

Clifford = So am I. I'm a little . . . euphoric about all that's
happening. 

Sidney = As well you should be. 

Myra = Would you like something to drink?

Clifford = Yes, please. Do you have some ginger ale?

Myra = Yes. Sidney? Scotch?

Sidney = No, dear, I believe I'll have ginger ale too. [This gives
Myra a moment's pause, after which she goes to the buffet.]

Clifford = These aren't /all/ from your plays, are they?

Sidney = No. I haven't written /that/ many. Friends give me things
now, and I prowl the antique shops. 

Myra = /There's/ a disease. 

Sidney = [Taking his keys out] Yes, and a super excuse for not
working. [ Indicating a pistol while en route to the desk.] I found
this in Ridgefield just the other day -- eighteenth-century German. 

Clifford = It's beautiful . . . 

Sidney = [Unlocking the desk's center drawer] As you can see, I'm
taking very good care of my "spiritual child." Lock and key . . . 

Clifford = [Unfastening his envelope] I've got the original. 

Sidney = [Taking the manuscript from the drawer] Thank God. I should
really be wearing glasses but my doctor told me the longer I can do
without them, the better off I am. [Offering the manuscript in the
wrong direction] Here you are. Oh, there you are. [Clifford smiles;
Myra turns to look and turns back to her ice and glasses. Clifford
takes a rubber-banded manuscript from the envelope]

Clifford = It's not in a binder. For the Xeroxing . . . 

Sidney = Makes no never-mind. [ They exchange manuscripts ] 

Clifford = I've got the first draft here too. [Sits near the desk.]
There's a scene between Diane and Carlo in Act One that I may have
been wrong to cut, and the Diane-and-Richard scene starts earlier,
before they know Carlo is back. 

Sidney = [Sitting behind the desk ] Did you do several drafts? 

Clifford = Just the one. It's a mess, but I think you'll be able to
decipher it, if you'd like to see those two scenes. 

Sidney = I would. By all means [ Clifford extracts a less tidy
manuscript from the envelope] I had a feeling there was a
Diane-and-Carlo scene I wasn't seeing . . . Before the murder?

Clifford = Yes. I was afraid the act would run too long. [ He hands
the second manuscript over.]

Sidney = Thanks. What else do you have in there?

Clifford = Oh, the outline, which I departed from considerably. I made
it the way you suggested, a page per scene, loose-leaf. And some lines
I jotted down and never got to use.

Sidney = Threw away the ones you did use as you usedthem?

Clifford = Yes. 

Sidney = Same way I work . . . [Myra comes over with glasses of ginger ale] 

Clifford = Everything was in the one envolope, so I just grabbed
it. [Taking a glass] Thank you.

Myra = You're welcome. [She give Sidney his glass, along with an intent look.]

Sidney = Thanks

Clifford = It's a two-hour walk to the station, so I had to leave
right after we talked. [Myra withdraws]

Sidney = /Two hours/?

Clifford = I walk longer than that; I'm one writer who's not going to
get flabby. I work out with weights every morning. I came /this close/
[Fingers slightly apart] to making the Olympic decathlon team. 

Sidney = Really?

Clifford = [hands wide apart] Well, /this/ close. 

Sidney = I'll be careful not to argue with you. I'm on the Olympic
sloth team. Gold medal. Fall asleep in any position. [ Raises his]
[ glass, pretends to fall asleep and wake up ] /Deathtrap/.

Clifford = /Deathtrap/.

Myra = /Deathtrap/. [Sidney turns. Myra is now seated, glass in hand,
needlework in her lap] It'll be toasted with more than ginger ale 
someday, if Sidney is right about it, and I'm sure he is. 

Clifford = I hope so. I toasted it with beer the other night. 

Myra = We have some. Would you rather? 

Clifford = No, no, this is fine, thanks. 

Sidney = [to Myra] Are you planning to stay in here?

Myra = Yes. 

Clifford = [ Manuscript open on his lap ] Do you think I overdid the
set description? All the exact locations for each piece of furniture?

Sidney = The set description? [Looking in the original manuscript] I
don't remember anything wrong with it . . . No, this is perfect,
couldn't be better. [Turns pages] You certainly type beautifully
. . . Electric? 

Clifford = No. I can't see electric typewriters; if there's a power
failure you can't work. 

Sidney = That's the whole point in owning one. [Turning another page]
No, the real trouble with them, I find -- with Zenobia here, at any
rate -- is that you can make only one decent carbon. The second carbon
is so muddy as to be almost illegible. [ Clifford turns a page, Myra
leans forward nervously] You don't have that problem with --  

Myra = [Interrupting the question ] Sidney has some wonderful ideas
for improving the play, Mr. Anderson!

Clifford = I'm -- sure he does. I'm looking forward to hearing them.

Sidney = Couldn't you do that in the living room, dear?

Myra = There's no good work light in there. 

Sidney = I seem to recall a paisley chair with a light beside it
bright enough for the engraving of Bibles on pinheads. 

Myra = It's /too/ bright, and the chair is too low. I'll be quiet. 

Sidney = Darling, this is Clifford's first play and I'm the first
person to read it. I'm sure he'd prefer our discussion to be
private. [to Clifford] Wouldn't you? Don't be emabarrassed to say so. 

Clifford = No, I don't mind Mrs. Bruhl being here. In fact, I like
it. It makes me feel a little less as if I've been summoned to the
pricipal's office. 

Sidney = Oh. [Myra settles in] I'm sorry if I awe you.

Clifford = You do. All those plays, and the things you say . . . I
never thought of calling my typewriter anything but Smith-Corona. 

Sidney = As long as it answers . . . 

Clifford = You're welcome to read the play too, Mrs. Bruhl, if you'd
like to. 

Myra = I would. 

Clifford = [ to Sidney ] I'm curious to know how women are going to
react to Diane's decision. About the gun.

Myra = Sidney told me a little about it at dinner, but he stopped at
the surprises. I don't even know who kills whom. 

Clifford = Good. You shouldn't. [to Sidney] I think that was the
trouble with /Murderer's Child/, if you'll forgive me for saying to
so. From the opening curtain it was so obvious that Dr. Mannheim was
going to bash poor Teddy. You didn't leave any room for doubt. I mean,
the audience should suspect, yes, but they shouldn't be absolutely
certain, should they? Doesn't that tend to diminish the suspense?

Sidney = Hmm . . . You may have a point there . . . I wish you had
mentioned on the phone that you wanted Myra to read it. I'd have told
you to bring another carbon, and she could be reading right now while
we have our talk. 

Clifford = I didn't know she'd be interested, and anyway, I don't have
one. [ Myra is sitting forward again ] 

Sidney = You don't have another carbon?

Clifford= I only made the one. I thought I'd be Xeroxing the original
as soon as I was through. 

Sidney = Of course. There's no need for two or three any more in the
age of Xerox. 

[ His eyes meet Myra's and glance away. Clifford
gestures with his manuscript toward Myra]  

Clifford = She could read this one, and we could pass the pages back
and forth. Or I could sit next to you.

Sidney = Wait. Let me think for a moment. 

[ Sidney thinks --
hard. Myra tries to contain her growing anxiety but can't ]  

Myra = Mr. Anderson, Sidney is bursting with creative ideas about your
play! I've never seen him so enthusiastic! He gets plays in the mail
very often, finished plays that are ready for production supposedly --
from his agent, from producers, from aspiring playwrights; and usually
he just laughs and sneers and says the most disparaging things you
could possibly imagine! I know he could improve your play
tremendously! He could turn it into a hit that would run for years and
years and make more than enough money for everyone concerned! [She
stops. Clifford stares. Sidney studies her.] 

Sidney = Is that what you meant by "I'll be quiet"?

Myra = [Putting her needlework aside ] I /won't/ be quiet. I'm going
to say something that's been on my mind ever since your phone
conversation. [Rising, advancing on Clifford] It's very wrong of you
to expect Sidney to give you the fruit of his years of experience, his
hard-won knowledge, without any quid pro quo, as if the seminar were
still in session!

Clifford = He /offered/ to give me -- 

Myra = [Turning on Sydney] And it's very wrong of /you/ to have
offered to give it to him! /I/ am the one in this household whose feet
are on the ground, and whose eye is on the checkbook! Now, I'm going
to make a suggestion to you, Sidney. It's going to come as a shock to
you, but I want you to give it your grave and thoughtful and earnest
consideration. Will you do that? Will you promise to do that for me?
[Sidney, staring, nods] /Put aside the play you're working on./ Yes,
put aside the play about Helga ten Dorp and how she /finds
murderers/, and keys under clothes dryers; put it aside, Sidney, and
help Mr. Anderson with /his/ play. Collaborate with him. /That's/ what
I'm suggesting. /That's/ what I think is the fair and sensible and
/rational/ thing to do in this situation. /Deathtrap/, by Clifford
Anderson and Sidney Bruhl. Unless Mr. Anderson feels that, in
deference to your age and reputation, it should be the other way
around.

Sidney = Hmm. That /is/ a shocker. Put aside . . . /The Drowning
Wife/?

Clifford = I thought it was "frowning."

Sidney = /Frowning/? No. What kind of title would that be? /The
Drowning Wife/ is what I'm calling it, at the moment. It has these
Women's Lib overtones, plus the ESP . . . [Looking doubtfully at Myra]
It's such a /timely/ play . . . 

Myra = /It will keep/, Sidney. People are always interested in psychics
who can point at someone [Points to him] and say . . . [Swings her
finger to Clifford] "This man -- murdered that man." [pointing at
Sidney again. She lowers her hand] Put is aside. Please. Do for
Mr. Anderson . . . what George S. Kaufman did for you.

Sidney = [Gives her a look, then thinks] That's awfully persuasive,
Myra. [To Clifford] How does it grab /you/?

Clifford = Oh wow. I suddenly feel as if I'm on the spot. 

Sidney = You are, really. Myra's put you there, put us both there. 

Myra = I felt it should be brought up now, before -- anything was
done. 

Sidney = Yes, yes, you were quite right. Quite right. [ Clifford is
thinking ] What's your reaction, Clifford?

Clifford = [rises] Well, first of all, I'm overwhelmed, really honored
and -- staggered, that Sidney Bruhl would even /consider/ the idea of
putting aside one of his own plays to work with me on mine. I mean,
there I was, sitting in that theatre when I was twelve years old, and
who would think that someday I'd be standing /here/, weighing the
chance to -- 

Sidney = [interrupting him] We get this gist of this passage. 

Clifford = It's a golden opportunity that I'm sure I ought to seize
with both hands. 

Myra = You should. Yes. 

Clifford = But . . . the thing is . . . it's as if I went to a doctor,
one of the world's leading specialists, and he recommended
surgery. Well, even with my respect for his eminence and his
experience, I would still want to get a second opinion, wouldn't I?
I'm sure your ideas are terrific, but you're right, Mrs. Bruhl, it
wouldn't be . . . fair for me to hear them now, without some sort of
an understanding or arrangement. And to be perfectly honest, right
now, /without/ having heard them, I feel that /Deathtrap/ is very good
as it is. Not perfect, certainly; I guess it could still use a little
fine-tuning. But -- I'm not sure it needs surgery . . . What I ought
to do, I think, is Xerox a few copies tomorrow morning and send them
off to some of those agents you recommended to us. If they say too
that it needs major rewriting, then I'll be coming back here begging
you to do what Mrs. Bruhl suggested, and I'll be willing to make
whatever arrangement you think is right. The same one you had with
Mr. Kaufman, I guess . . . I hope I haven't offended you.

Sidney = Not at all. 

Myra = Mr. Anderson, please. Agents know about contracts; they don't
know -- 

Sidney = [Interrupting her, gathering the two manuscripts together]
Don't, Myra. Don't beg him. He'll think he has the wealth of the
Indies here, and we're Mr. and Mrs. Jean Lafitte. 

Clifford = I'd never think anything like that, Mr. Bruhl. I'm grateful
that you're willing to go out of your way to help me. 

Sidney = But I'm not, really. Now that I've had a moment to consider
the matter, I would never put aside a play as timely and inventive as
/The Drowning Wife/ to do wet nurse work on one as speculative as
/Deathtrap/. [Hands the manuscripts over] Sit down, Myra. You're
making me nervous, standing there hyper ventilating. [Myra withdraws a
bit, warily] Do as you said -- show it to a few agents. And if you
decide that major rewrites /are/ in order, get in touch. Who knows, I
might hit a snag; it's happened once or twice. 

Clifford = [Fitting the two manuscripts into the envelope] Thank you,
I will. [Myra withdraws farther]

Sidney = Though I doubt I shall; I have it completely outlined and I'm
more than halfway done. And I have another play ready to go next,
based on the life of Harry Houdini. 

Clifford = Oh? 

Sidney = [Rising] Yes, magic is very in now. Look at the success of
/The Magic Show/. Houdini's always been an idol of mine. [Taking
handcuffs from the wall] These are a pair of his handcuffs . . . 

Myra = [On edge again] Sidney . . . 

Sidney = Relax, darling; Clifford isn't the type of person who would
steal someone else's idea. [to Clifford] You wouldn't do that, would
you?

Clifford = Of course not. 

Sidney = See? No cause for alarm. "His heart as far from fraud as
heaven from earth." A remarkable man, Houdini. Made all his own
magical apparatus, did you know that?

Clifford = No, I didn't. 

Sidney = Magnificent craftsmanship. Have a look. [Tosses the open
handcuffs to Clifford]

Myra = Sidney, /please/!

Sidney = /Sit down, Myra/.

Myra = Don't! I beg you! For God's sake, /think/!

Sidney = He's an /honest young man/! Now, will you sit down and stop
being so all-fired suspicious of everyone who comes through that door?
[to Clifford] We has a very nasty experience a few years back
involving a plagaristic playwright whose name I won't mention, since
he's gone to his Maker, recalled for repairs. Ever since, Myra has
gotten alarmed if I so much as tell a fellow writer the language I'm
working in. Don't take it personally. Have a good look at those;
they're quite remarkable.

[Myra has turned away in anxiety. Sidney glances uneasily at her while
Clifford, who has rested his envelope and bound manuscript against the
leg of his chair, examines the antique handcuffs. Myra sits, facing
away from them]

Clifford = They look so old . . . 

Sidney = They were made to. And apparently solid and escape-proof. 

Clifford = They certainly seem that way. 

Sidney = Be my guest. 

Clifford = You mean put them on?

Sidney = Yes. That's what I mean when you're holding my prize pair of
twelve-hundred-dollar Houdini handcuffs and I say, "Be my guest": "Put
them on."

Clifford = Twelve hundred dollars . . . Whew! 

[Impressed, he locks
the handcuffs onto his wrists. Myra sits wincing]

Sidney = Now turn your wrists like this, press, and pull. [ Clifford
follows the directions -- and is still handcuffed ] You didn't do it
right; it's got to be a single quick motion. Try again. [Clifford
does; no dice] Turn, press, pull; all in one. [Clifford makes several
more tries]

Clifford = No, they're not opening. 

Sidney = Hmm. They did for me yesterday morning; it's not a question
of their not being oiled. 

Clifford = [Still trying] I guess I'm just not Houdini . . . 

Sidney = It's all right, I've got the key here. Somewhere. [Begins
rummaging nervously about the desktop] Don't go on fussing with them;
you're liable to ruin them.

Clifford = Sorry. 

[He sits still. Myra turns around, slowly,
fearfully. Clifford smiles sheepishly at her; she tries to smile
back. Sidney goes on searching]

Sidney = Key, key, key, key, key. Where are you, little brass key?

[He begins looking in drawers. Clifford looks at his handcuffed
wrists, and at Myra, and at Sidney, and gets an idea]

Clifford = Do you know, this could be a good thriller! [Sidney looks
at him] It could! I mean it!

Sidney = How so?

Clifford = Well . . . a young playwright sends his first play to an
older playwright who conducted a seminar that the young playwright
attended. Nobody else has read it, and then he comes to /visit/ the
older playwright, /to get some ideas for rewrites/, and he brings
along the original and all his notes and everything. Of course, you'd
have to have the Xerox breaking down, to explain why there are only
the two copies, and the play would have to be a very good one -- the
one the young playwright wrote, I mean -- and the older playwright
would have to have nothing much going for him at the time . . . 

Sidney = An enormous concatenation of unlikely circumstances, don't
you think? 

Clifford = Yes, maybe . . . But we've almost got it here, haven't we?
The only difference is that you've got /The Drowning Wife/ and the
Houdini play, and /Deathtrap/ probably isn't worth killing for
. . . I'll be nobody even saw me getting into your car . . . 

Sidney = Well, there you are: You've licked the second play problem. [
He resumes searching]

Clifford = I think it could be turned into something fairly
interesting . . . What do you think, Mrs. Bruhl. 

Myra = I -- don't like it. It frightens me. 

Sidney = [Turning to the weapons on the wall] I wonder it I could have
put it up here somewhere. 

[Clifford looks curiously at Myra, and at
Sidney nervously touching the various weapons, and at his handcuffed
wrists. He thinks a bit. And a bit more. And a lot more. He thinks
very hard.]

Clifford = Oh, I forgot to mention -- I should be getting a phone call
any minute now. [Sidney turns and looks at him] There's a girl who's
coming to see me at eight-thirty -- that's around what it is now,
isn't it? -- and I couldn't reach her before I left, so I left a note
on the hall mirror telling her where I am and giving the
number [Rising and backing away] so she can call and find out what
train I'll be taking back. So she can pick me up at the station. One
two-hour walk per day is just about enough for me. [Turns and smiles]
So I hop you find the key soon, or else you're going to have to hold
the phone for me.

Sidney = [Stands looking at him for a moment] How is she going to get
in to /read/ the note?

Clifford = She has a key. 

Sidney = You're not a very conscientious house-sitter.

Clifford = She's honest. 

Sidney = You said in the car that you don't know anyone in Milford
except a few trades people. 

Clifford = She's from Hartford. Her name is Marietta Klenofski and she
teaches at Quirk Middle School. Phys Ed. 

Sidney = Where did you get the number? It's not listed.

Clifford = They gave it to me at the university, along with your
address. I'm friendly with Mrs. Beecham there. 

Sidney = Beecham?

Clifford = The short red-haired lady. With the eye-shade.

Sidney = I hope she gave you the right number. I had it changed a few
weeks ago -- an obscene caller was boring us -- and I don't think I
notified old U. of Conn. What number did you leave for Ms. Klenofski?

Clifford = I can't remember it. 

Sidney = Two-two-six, three-oh-four-nine? Or two-two-six,
five-four-five-seven?

Clifford = The first one. Three-oh-four-nine.

Sidney = The new number. Hmm. I must have notified the university and
clean forgot about it. How strange, and how untypical of me.

Clifford = Would you go on looking for the key, please?

Sidney = Certainly. [Turns, considers, reaches to the wall]

Myra = /My heart won't take it/!

Sidney = [Plucking something from a ledge] Won't take what, dear?
[Turning, showing a key] My finding the key? [Looks at Myra, and at
Clifford] I do believe the two of you thought I was going to grab the
mace and do a Dr. Mannheim . . . Clifford? Is that why you've
withdrawn so far upstage?

Clifford = [Shrugs uncomfortably, points toward his chair] You can't
write a play like that and not have a mind that . . . envisions possibilities.

Sidney = True, very true. I'm slightly paranoid myself. [Coming around
the desk] What's /your/ excuse, oh loyal and trusting wife? [Myra
looks at him -- as he puts the key on a table by Clifford's chair --
and turns away ] Eleven years of marriage and she thinks I'm capable
of a flesh-and-blood murder. There's a lesson for you in that,
Clifford. Come uncuff yourself. /Deathtrap/ is promising, but it's not
/that/ promising.

[He moves back around the desk.]

Clifford = [Going toward the chair] I'm glad it isn't.

Sidney = No, I think your best invention so far is the name "Marietta
Klenofski". That's lovely. I congratulate you.

Clifford = Thanks. [Sitting in the chair, he picks up the key and
leans his hands into the lamplight]

Sidney = I can see the sweat on her forearms after the basketball game
. . . Mrs. Beecham's eyeshade, I thought, was a bit much. 

Clifford = I thought it was the kind of convincing detail you told us
to try for. Are you sure this is the right key?

Sidney = [Coming around to him] Ye gods, Houdini opened them inside a
milk can under ten feet of water; do you mean to say you can't do it
in -- 

[He whips a garrotte around Clifford's throat, and pulling at
its two handles, hauls him upward from the chair. Clifford, choking,
tries to get his fingers under the wire but can't. Myra whirls,
screaming]

Myra = /My God, Sidney! Stop! Stop it!/

Sidney = /Stay back! Stay away!/

Myra = /Oh my God! My God!/

[Clifford has thrust his manacled hands back over his head, trying to
find Sidney's head, while Sidney, grimly determined, strains at the
garrotte handles. The chair tumbles. Myra turns away, her hands over
her face, moaning and crying. Sidney hauls Clifford about by the
garrotte, evading his groping hands, his kicking legs. A lamp
falls. Clifford catches one of Sidney's hands and wrenches at
it. Blood trickles down Clifford's wire-bound throat. Myra turns and
looks and turns away again, never stopping her moaning and
lamentation. Clifford, pop-eyed and hawking, falls forward before the
fireplace, his shackled arms outflung; Sidney goes down with him and
kneels astride him, keeping his fierce hold on the handles. When
Clifford is finally and surely dead, Sidney relaxes his grip, lets go,
sits for a moment on Clifford's back, then reaches forward and feels
at a wrist within its handcuff. Myra sits, weeping, moaning. Sidney
gets up, breathing hard, trembling a little. He gets out his
handkerchief, wipes his hands and face, looks at Myra. He rights the
chair, picks up the lamp, puts it in its place, and straightens its
shade -- not very successfully because his hands are shaking badly
now. He clasps them a moment, then turns to the desk, picks up a key,
and crouching beside Clifford, unlocks and removes the handcuffs. He
rises, wiping the cuffs with the handkerchief, and goes and replaces
them on the wall, then returns to Clifford's body. Myra is staring at
him.]

Sidney = Right on the rug. One point for neatness. [He crouches again
and unwinds the garrotte from Clifford's throat, then turns the ends
of the hearthrug over Clifford's body. Rising, he wipes the garrotte
with the handkercheif, and meets Myra's wondering stare] Your heart
seems to have taken it. 

Myra = [Keeps staring at him awhile] Barely.

Sidney = [Looks away, wiping at the garrotte] We'll give it a rest on
the Riviera, after the opening. And we'll have a housekeeper again, so
you can take things easy. Another car too, a Rolls. [Looks at the
blood-streaked handkerchief, wipes the garrotte some more]

Myra = We're going to be in prison.

Sidney = [Throws the handkerchief into the fireplace and crosses the
room] A young would-be playwright walks away from his house-sitting
job. The police won't even bother to yawn. [He puts the garrotte in
its place]

Myra = Leaving his clothes? And his typewriter?

Sidney = Why not? Who can figure these young people nowadays?
Especially would-be writers. Maybe he realized he /wouldn't/ be --
[Picking up the envelope and the bound manuscript] -- and went off to
preach ecology. [Going back behind the desk] Or to join the Reverend
Sun Myung Moon. [Puts the envelope and manuscript down, opens the
manuscript] Who knows? The place might be broken into, and poor little
Smith-Corona stolen. [He tears out the first page and puts it aside;
unfastens the envelope and takes out the two unbound manuscripts;
removes their first pages]

Myra = What are you -- going to do with him?

Sidney = [Examining other papers that were in the envelope] Bury
him. Behind the garage. No, in the vegetable patch -- easier
digging. 

[He examines the last scraps of paper and puts them down;
opens the desk's center drawer and puts the three manuscripts into it;
closes and locks it. Myra puts her face into her hands, overcome by
grief and shock again. Sidney gathers the papers and loose pages, the
envelope, the letter than came with the play] 

Take a brandy or
something. 

[ He goes to the fireplace, and crouching by Clifford's
body, tosses everything in; takes a match from a holder, strikes it,
and sets the papers afire. He tosses the match in, rises, watches
the moves away and faces Myra, who is studying him] 

I'm going to be a
winner again! All our dear friends are going to see /you/ living on
/my/ money! Picture their confusion. 

[Myra looks into her lap. Sidney
goes and throws open the draperies, unbolts and opens the French
doors. He looks toward the treetops] 

Full moon, all right. 

[He comes
back to the hearth, and crouching, rearranges Clifford's body for
carrying] 

I hope this isn't going to become a monthly practice. 

[He
straightens up, takes his jacket off and puts it on a chair, rubs his
hands and readies himself; meets Myra's gaze] 

Would you mind helping me
carry him? [Myra looks at him for a moment, and looks away] It's been
/done/, Myra. I don't see the point in my getting a hernia. 

[Myra
looks at him again, and after a moment, rises and comes over. The
lights begin dimming as Sidney lifts Clifford's rug-wrapped
shoulders. Myra lifts his feet. They heft him up between them and
carry him toward the French doors, Sidney going backwards] 

Thank God
he wasn't the fat one. [The lights fade to darkness]

scene: three

 
[When the lights come up, Myra is sitting and thinking, an empty
brandy glass in her hand. The moodlight outside the French doors is
stronger now and coming from directly overhead.]

[Myra looks at her glass, and after a moment, rises, goes to the
buffet, and pours herself a small amount of brandy. Sidnet comes to
the French doors, wipes his feet, brushes dirt from his trouser legs,
and enters. He looks at Myra -- who has turned and is looking at him
-- and enters, closes the doors, and pulls the draperies over them. He
comes farther into the room.]

Sidney = Make mine a double. I've got myself a bit of a chill. [Takes
the breast-pocket handkerchief from his jacket on the chair; wipes his
hands] Along with incipient blisters, aching arms, and small devils
poking pitchforks into what I believe is my lubago. [Picks up the
jacket, puts it on] In /Murderer's Child/ I had Dr. Mannheim bury
Teddy in forty-five minutes. In future I'll know better. [Myra goes
and resumes her seat while Sidney puts the handkerchief back in his
breast pocket and picks up the wrong handcuff key from the floor]
We're out one hearthrug, but I saw some nice ones in the Yield House
the other day. [He pockets the key, puts the chair in its exact place;
sees Myra sitting and no sign of his brandy. He considers this, then
picks up the ginger-ale glasses and heads for the buffet] I have a
feeling you're about to deliver a speech. Would you mind holding off
until I've poured my own brandy and sat down? 

Myra = I had intended to. I've learned /something/ in eleven years of
melodrama.

Sidney = Good girl. [Pours his brandy and crosses with it, groaning
and rubbing the small of his back; sits, painfully, sips the brandy,
and stretches out a bit more comfortably] Go. 

Myra = [Waits a moment, and does] I'd be very happy living on your
money, but I don't relish the thought of living on his. I've tried to
understand how you could do it, bearing in mind your disappointments
and your . . . embarrassment in our financial situation, but I
can't. And how will you be able to feel like a winner when we'll both
know it's his play? I can't understand that either. You're . . . alien
to me, Sidney, and it can't be only since five o'clock this
afternoon. You must always have been very different from the person I
thought you were. [Sidney is troubled by the speech] I don't think the
police are going to be as unconcerned as you do, so I don't want
anything to happen that will look suspicious if they come to question
us, but -- 

Sidney = [Interrupting her] How will they? He vanished from Milford;
this is Westport.

Myra = They'll check into his past associations! He must have gotten
your address from the university, even if he did lie about the phone
number!

Sidney = If they come I'll simply say he wrote to me. A twerpy little
letter asking for advice. And I answered it. Or maybe I just threw it
away.

Myra = [ Rises, goes to the buffet, puts her glass down and turns ] In
a month or so, if we haven't been arrested, I want you to leave. We'll
have a few arguments in people's living rooms -- you can write them
for us, little tiffs about money or something -- and then you'll move
out. I wish you could take the vegetable patch with you, but since you
can't, you'll buy it from me, as soon as the money starts rolling
in. Before the Rolls-Royce and before you go to the Riviera! [Sidney,
concerned, rises and starts toward her; she's growing more distraught]
You'll buy the vegetable patch, and the house, and the whole
nine-point-three acres! We'll get Buck Raymond or Maury Escher to set
a fair price! [She turns and moves away, near tears, as Sidney reaches
for her]

Sidney = Darling, you've had a shocking and --

Myra = Get away from me!

Sidney = You've had a shocking and painful experience and so have
I. I'm terrified that I'll be caught and absolutely guilt-ridden about
having been insane enough to do it. I'm going to give half the money
to the New Dramatists League, I swear I am! . . . This isn't the time
to talk about /anything/. In a few days, when we're both outselves
again, things will look much cheerier. 

Myra = You /are/ yourself, right now. And so am I. In a few days --
[The doorbell chime stops her. Sidney freezes. Myra points toward the
door] Go ahead. "He wrote me a twerpy letter, Officer."

Sidney = It must be Lottie and Ralph, come to yammer about the movie
. . . 

Myra = [Wiping her cheeks] It's probably Helga ten Dorp. 

Sidney = Don't be silly. [ The doorbell chimes again] It's Lottie and
Ralph, damn them. We've got to let them it. Can you face them? Maybe
you'd better go upstairs. I'll tell them you -- 

Myra = [Interrupting him] No. I'll stay here, and let you worry that
I'll fall apart! 

[ Sidney eyes her anxiously. The doorbell chimes a
third time. Sidney starts for the door]

Sidney = Coming! [ Myra tries to compose herself; moves into view of
the door] Who is it?

Helga = [Offstage] I am your neighbor in house of
McBains. Please, will you let me come it? [Sidney  turns,
wide-eyed. Myra too is startled and frightened] Is most urgent I speak
to you. I call the information but the lady will tell me not your
number. Please, will you let me come in? [Sidney turns to the door] I
am friend of Paul Wyman. Is most urgent!

Sidney = [Opening the door] Come in. 

[Helga ten Dorp comes into the foyer, a stocky strong-jawed Teutonic
woman in her early fifties, in the throes of considerable
distress. She wears slacks and a hastily seized and unfastened jacket] 

Helga = I apologize for so late I come, but you will forgive when I
make the explaining. [ She comes into the study. Sidney closes the
door] Ja, ja, is room I see. Beams, and window like so . . . [Holds
her forhead, wincing] And the pain! Such pain! [ Sees Myra and
recognizes her as the source of it; approaches her ]
Pain. Pain. Pain. Pain. [ Moves her hands about Myra, as if wanting to
touch and comfort her but unable to] Pain. Pain. Pain!

Sidney = [ Coming nervously toward her ] We're neither of us up to
snuff today . . . 

Helga = [ Turns, sees the weapons ] /Ei/! Just as I see them! /Uuuch/!
Why keep you such pain-covered things?

Sidney = They're antiques, and souvenirs from plays. I'm a
playwright. 

Helga = Ja, Sidney Bruhl; Paul Wyman tells me. We make together book. 

Sidney = My wife Myra . . . 

Myra = How do you do . . .

Helga = What gives you such pain, dear lady? 

Myra = Nothing. I'm -- fine, really.

Helga = No, no; something you see pains you. [To both of them] Paul
tells you of /me/? I am Helga ten Dorp. I am psychic.

Sidney = Yes, he did. In fact, we were going to ask --

Helga = [Interrupting him] For hours now I feel the pain from
here. And more than pain. Since eight-thirty, when begins /The Merv
Griffin Show/. I am on it next week; you will watch?

Sidney = Yes, yes, certainly. Make a note of that, Myra. 

Helga = Thursday night. Peter Hurkos also. What they want /him/ for, I
do not know. I call the Information but the lady will tell me not your
number. I call Paul but he is not at home; he is in place with red
walls, eating with chopsticks. I call the Information again. I say,
"Is urgent, you /must/ tell me number; I am Helga ten Dorp. I am
psychic." She say, "Guess number." I try, but only I see the
two-two-six, which is everybody, ja? So I come here now. [ Looking
sympathetically at Myra] Because pain gets worse. And more than pain
. . . 

[She moves away and wanders the room, a hand to her
forhead. Sidney and Myra look anxiously at each other.]

Myra = More than pain? 

Helga = Ja, is something else here, something frightening. No, it will
interfere.

Sidney = What will? 

Helga = The drink you would give me. Must keep unclouded the
head. Never drink. Only when images become too may. Then I get
drunk. [She goes close to the weapons, one hand to her forehead, the
other hand passing back and forth. Sidney and Myra stand motionless as
Helga's hand passes over the garrotte. She takes up the dagger, turns
with it, closes her eyes] Was used many times by beautiful dark-haired
woman. But only pretending -- 

Sidney = That's amazing! It's from my play /The Murder Game/ and it
was used every night by a beautiful dark-haired actress!

Helga = Will be used again. By another woman. Not in play. But
. . . /because/ of play . . . [Opens her eyes] Because of play,
another woman uses this knife. [Sidney and Myra start at her. She
replaces the dagger] You should put away these things.

Sidney = Yes, yes, I think I will. In a month or so I'll sell the
whole collection. Tired of them anyway.

Helga = May be too late. [Looks gravely at Sidney and Myra] I do not
enjoy to make-unhappy people, but I must speak when I see something,
ja?

Sidney = Well, I don't know actually; you /could/ keep quiet. I mean,
you're supposed to be resting, aren't you? Not in your own country -- 

Helga = Must speak. Is why God gives gift. Is danger here. Much
danger. [To Sidney] To you. [To Myra] And to you. Is -- death in this
room. Is something that -- invites death, that carries death
. . . Deathtrap? This is word in English, "deathtrap"?

Myra = Yes . . . 

Sidney = It's the title of a play I've been working on. That's where
you've got it from. There's a death in the play; I'm sure that's what
you're . . . responding to. I've been working there at the deak. 

Helga = [Moving around the desk, touching it] Maybe . . . But feels
like /real/ death.

Sidney = I try to be convincing, act everything out as I write it. 

[ Helga's attention is caught by the chair in which Clifford sat. She
goes to it, hesitates, takes hold of its back with both hands, closes
her eyes, throws back her head. Myra trembles; Sidney puts a hand to
her shoulder. ]

Helga = Man . . . in boots . . . Young man . . . [Opens her eyes,
looks at Sidney] Here in this room -- he attacks you. 

Sidney = He -- attacks me?

Helga = [Indicating the weapons] With one of those. Comes as
friend. To help you? To work with you? But attacks. [Closes her eyes,
shakes her head] Is confusion here . . . 

Sidney = Yes, well, I'll certainly be on the lookout for a young man
in boots! We're going to be Japanese from now on -- shoes off at the
door!

Helga = He sites in this chair . . . and he talks of . . . Diane
. . . 

Sidney = There's a Diane in the play. 

Helga = And two other people . . . Smith -- and Colonna. No, one
person. Small. Black. [Opens her eyes] Is in play a black man, Smith
Colonna?

Sidney = Never heard the name before. 

Helga = [Closes her eyes again] Is very confusing image. [Shakes her
head, opens her eyes] Is gone now. Nothing else comes. 

Sidney = Well, that was a most impressive demonstration! Wasn't it
dear? [To Helga, who is coming away from the chair, collecting
herself] The way you picked up the name of the play, and Diane, and
the dagger business -- really awesome!

Helga = Remember what else I tell you. Dagger is used again, by woman,
because of play. And man in boots attacks you. Of these two things I
am certain. All else is -- confusing. [To Myra] Pain is less now, ja?

Myra = Yes. There wasn't any, really. [She smiles nervously at her]

Sidney = What a marvelous gift! I must confess I've been skeptical
about ESP, but you've convinced me it's genuine. 

Helga = Oh yes, is genuine, and sometime not happy gift to be owner
of. 

Myra = Have you always had it?

Helga = Since I was child. Never could I enjoy a game of
hide-and-go-seek. Was too easy, you understand? And parents did not
wrap Christmas presents -- why wasting paper? Later, in my teen ages,
walking with boys -- /ach/, such images!

Sidney = Won't you have that drink now? I'd like very much to talk
with you.

Helga = No, thank you. I must go back to house. You will come take
dinner with me sometime. I will tell you all of my life. Would make
very good play. [To Myra] When child you are living in large house
with yellow shutters, /ja/? 

Myra = That's right! Yes!

Helga = [Nods complacently] Always when moon is full I am in top
form. [Shakes Myra's hand] Good night. 

Myra = Good night. 

Helga = [ Her face clouds; she touches Myra's cheek] Be careful. [She
releases Myra's hand and turns and takes Sidney's, which he gives a
shade uneasily] You also . . . 

Sidney = I intend to. No boots allowed. Good night. 

Helga = Good night. [ She turns and starts toward the foyer, Sidney
following. Helga stops, turns, points warningly at Sidney and at Myra]
Remember. Thursday night -- Merv Griffin Show.  [She turns and goes
out the front door. Sidney closes and bolts it, then comes back into
the study.]

Sidney = Well! If that's the best she can do, there's nothing to worry
about. 

Myra = You're not afraid of the danger she saw? 

Sidney = Not especially. 

Myra = We're going to be arrested!

Sidney = I don't see how. If the police /do/ come by, and /do/ bring
her into it -- which hardly seems likely -- well, what of it? She'll
have them combing the tri-state area for a small black boy with two
spools of ribbon. [Indicating his ears] One here, one here, going
through his mouth. 

Myra = She saw him sitting there! She heard him speaking!

Sidney = But she had the main point backwards! [Takes Myra's
shoulders] You'll see; there's nothing to worry about. I'll boil that
thing [pointing to the garrotte] tomorrow morning, or throw it in the
garbage, and that'll be the end of it. In a week or so it'll all be
behind us. [Myra turns away, moves from his hands] I couldn't help
myself, Myra. I saw that play going out into the world tomorrow
morning, and him sitting there so young, so lucky . . . Don't decide
yet about kicking the old boy out. And please, I beg you, don't
entertain thoughts of using the dagger. [Myra turns, shocked] Just a
joke. That was another of her confused images, I'm sure. Though if we
do get a housekeeper, I'll want her to have terrifically good
references.

Myra = Sell the collection. 

Sidney = Probably I should. [Turning to look at it, moving closer] I
will. Not right away, though; it would look too suspicious. [Picks up
the dagger, toys with it] Amazing, isn't it? Eighteen years, and
Tanya's aura still permeates it. 

Myra = Put it away somewhere.

Sidney = [Shrugs, opens a desk drawer and puts the dagger into it,
closes it] Exit dagger, into desk. [He switches the desk lamp off]

Myra = Part of me -- was hoping you would do it. [Nods] At the same
time that I was terrified you would, part of me was hoping. I saw the
money too. And your name . . . [Sidney goes to her, takes her in his
arms; she stands passively]

Sidney = You tried to stop me, you did your best. It was my doing and
mine only. You helped me carry him because I asked you to, and you
were too stunned and too . . . in the habit of helping me to
refuse. If anything should go wrong, there must never be any confusion
whatsoever on that point. [He raises her chin and kisses her on the
lips; she begins to respond to the kiss] But nothing /will/ go
wrong. In a few weeks, we'll be celebrating. "Leading Producer Options
New Sidney Bruhl Thriller. Successful Playwrights Admit Envy." [Myra
tries to smile. Sidney gives her a brief second kiss] Let's lock up
and turn in. [He goes to turn a lamp off. Myra hesitates, then turns
another lamp off] Is it possible that murder is an aphrodesiac? What a
blow that would be to importers of ginseng root, not to mention the
Department of Health, Education, and -- EEEAH!

[He has cried out because he has put his hand between the draperies to
check the doorbolt, and the hand has been seized by Clifford, who,
covered with dirt, comes through the draperies trying to brain Sidney
with a length of firewood. Myra cowers, dumbstruck and paralyzed with
terror. In the light from the foyer and the one lamp still lit,
Clifford's bloody throat can be seen as he wields the firewood. Sidney
tries to parry it with his free arm, but Clifford wrenches the captive
have up behind Sidney's back and forces him to the desk and down onto
it. Clifford beats and smashes at Sidney's head, each blow audible,
till Sidney lies still. Myra moans and gibbers, biting at her
fingers. Clifford prods Sidney a few times, then stands straight,
draws a deep breath, and turns. Raising the length of firewood, he
advances on Myra]

Myra = No. No. Please. He couldn't help himself. [She retreats around
the side of a chair as Clifford comes closer, raises the firewood
higher] I tried to stop -- 

[Her left arm shoots out straight as she
falls against the side of the chair, gasping clutching her chest. She
hangs frozen over the chair arm for a moment -- while Clifford stands
over her ready to swing -- and then her eyes glaze and she slips back
down slowly to the floor. Clifford is wary, uncertain. He looks down
at her, then crouches, the firewood still upraised. With his left
hand, he checks her partly concealed body, holding her wrist, moving
her head from side to side, touching her throat. He lowers the
firewood and stands up straight; looks down at her for a moment,
breathing deeply.]

Clifford = She's dead . . . I'm positive. [Sidney bestirs himself and
gets up from the desk. Rubbing himself and straightening his jacket,
he comes and stands by Clifford; the look down at Myra] It worked
. . . 

[Lights out]
